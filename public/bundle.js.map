To do this, we use a common technique of applying\n * the `aria-hidden='true'` attribute to the non-Modal elements in the Modal `container`. This means that for\n * a Modal to be truly modal, it should have a `container` that is _outside_ your app's\n * React hierarchy (such as the default: document.body).\n */\n\nvar Modal = function (_React$Component) {\n  _inherits(Modal, _React$Component);\n\n  function Modal() {\n    var _ref;\n\n    var _temp, _this, _ret;\n\n    _classCallCheck(this, Modal);\n\n    for (var _len = arguments.length, args = Array(_len), _key = 0; _key < _len; _key++) {\n      args[_key] = arguments[_key];\n    }\n\n    return _ret = (_temp = (_this = _possibleConstructorReturn(this, (_ref = Modal.__proto__ || Object.getPrototypeOf(Modal)).call.apply(_ref, [this].concat(args))), _this), _initialiseProps.call(_this), _temp), _possibleConstructorReturn(_this, _ret);\n  }\n\n  _createClass(Modal, [{\n    key: 'omitProps',\n    value: function omitProps(props, propTypes) {\n\n      var keys = Object.keys(props);\n      var newProps = {};\n      keys.map(function (prop) {\n        if (!Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(propTypes, prop)) {\n          newProps[prop] = props[prop];\n        }\n      });\n\n      return newProps;\n    }\n  }, {\n    key: 'render',\n    value: function render() {\n      var _props = this.props;\n      var show = _props.show;\n      var container = _props.container;\n      var children = _props.children;\n      var Transition = _props.transition;\n      var backdrop = _props.backdrop;\n      var dialogTransitionTimeout = _props.dialogTransitionTimeout;\n      var className = _props.className;\n      var style = _props.style;\n      var onExit = _props.onExit;\n      var onExiting = _props.onExiting;\n      var onEnter = _props.onEnter;\n      var onEntering = _props.onEntering;\n      var onEntered = _props.onEntered;\n\n\n      var dialog = _react2.default.Children.only(children);\n      var filteredProps = this.omitProps(this.props, Modal.propTypes);\n\n      var mountModal = show || Transition && !this.state.exited;\n      if (!mountModal) {\n        return null;\n      }\n\n      var _dialog$props = dialog.props;\n      var role = _dialog$props.role;\n      var tabIndex = _dialog$props.tabIndex;\n\n\n      if (role === undefined || tabIndex === undefined) {\n        dialog = (0, _react.cloneElement)(dialog, {\n          role: role === undefined ?
